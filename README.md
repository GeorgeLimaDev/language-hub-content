### How do I add a download file to my article?

1. Open a branch in the [help-portal-content](https://github.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content) repository.
2. Copy the file you want to make available for download to the same directory as the article where it will be inserted. For instance, to allow the user to download a spreadsheet within the article **[Payment Provider List](https://github.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/blob/b454803127cc490362c16921ceee023a5d182409/docs/pt/tutorials/Payments/Payment%20Settings/list-of-payment-providers-by-country.md)**, you need to save it in the directory [vtexdocs/help-center-content/docs/pt/tutorials/Payments/Payment Settings](https://github.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/docs/pt/tutorials/Payments/Payment_Settings/).
3. Go to the [branches page](https://github.com/vtexdocs/help-center-content/branches), and under **Your branches** section, click on the name of the branch you created.
