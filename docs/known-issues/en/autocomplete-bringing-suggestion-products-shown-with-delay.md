## Summary



There's some stores where the suggestions have a delay displaying the items on the autocomplete, this causes to the user of this store to see other products instead of those they are looking for, impacting their navigation. This isn't a expected behavior, since this happens to a few stores and for others using the same component the same behavior doesn't happen.
