## Summary


When a component of kit look is without stock, the entire kit is shown as sold out on searching.



## Simulation


- Create a Kit Look;
- Set the stock of one of the components to unavailable;
- The Kit Look page will be unavailable.


## Workaround


Only use kit look if you're sure that all the components have stock.
