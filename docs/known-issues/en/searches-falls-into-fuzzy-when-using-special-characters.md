## Summary


When searching terms with special characters such as commas (`,`), apostrophes (`'`), hashes (`#`) and colons (`:`), it triggers fallback and fuzzy, making search results looks weird.



## Simulation


Search for an item with any of these examples and you will see that the result is not what's expected, usually removing the char and/or not considering anything after it.




## Workaround


None available.
