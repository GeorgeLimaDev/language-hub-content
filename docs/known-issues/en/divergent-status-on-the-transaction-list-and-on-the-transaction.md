## Summary


The status of the transactions is different once you open them compared to what is shown in the transaction's list.



## Simulation


Since it does not happen in all transactions, the way to simulate it is to enter a random transaction and check if the status inside it is the same as it is set on the transaction list.
Once you enter into the transaction, in fact, the status is different



## Workaround


There isn't a workaround.
