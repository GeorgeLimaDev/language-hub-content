## Summary


We had a scenario where a product even with a synonym applied a to it, it doesn't appear on the Explained Search screen. This usually happens with unidirectional synonyms.


##

## Simulation


Create a unidirectional synonym and them check it on the explained search, if it doesn't appear it actually doesn't mean today that the synonym isn't working.


##

## Workaround


There's none.
