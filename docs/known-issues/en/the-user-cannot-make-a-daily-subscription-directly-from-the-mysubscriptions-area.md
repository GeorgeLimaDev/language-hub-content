## Summary


The logged-in user can't make a daily subscription directly from the Subscription tab in the My Account. The button seems unresponsive, and no error message appears. It looks like other frequencies, such as monthly or annually subscriptions, are operating normally.



## Simulation


— Log in to a VTEX store
— Go into the “My Orders” area and click on “Subscriptions”
— Create a new subscription, select a product and choose the daily frequency
— Fill out the payment and shipping information
— Notice that the “Subscribe” button doesn't seem to be working



## Workaround


The client or the call center operator can make the subscription normally by using the traditional shopping flow, navigating on the website.
