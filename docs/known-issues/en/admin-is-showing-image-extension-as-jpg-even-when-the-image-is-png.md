## Summary


On the image export page or in the exported image report, the URL of the images is with the extension .jpg even when the image is PNG. However, the incorrect information in the Admin does not affect the actual format of the image, and by accessing the image URL from the front you can see that the image is still PNG.



## Simulation


- Upload an image on an SKU, in PNG format
- Go to Import and Export menu, on the Export Image page OR export the image report and check the image URL



## Workaround
