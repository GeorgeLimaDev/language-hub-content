## Summary


Currently, the CMS allows the creation of folders with the same names as the default folders, but later does not allow editing/deleting these new folders



## Simulation


- Create folders in the CMS with the possible names: "Busca", "Categoria", "Departamento", "Login", "Produto" and save
- Try deleting or editing the folder name
- Note that you will be returned with the message "This is a default folder and cannot be deleted"



## Workaround


N/A
