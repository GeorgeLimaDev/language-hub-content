## Summary



Nominal discount is not being distributed among all items in the cart.

This scenario is only happening in a few accounts.

The store has a nominal promotion and the discount is only being applied on the one item in the cart, not proportionally distributing the discount to all the items like is supposed to.


##

## Simulation




1. Create a regular promotion with a nominal discount;
2. Create a cartlink where the promotion is applicable;
3. Check that the discount is being entirely applied on just one item instead of be distributed among all items.

PS: This doesn't happen everytime and with every account.


##

## Workaround


No workaround.
