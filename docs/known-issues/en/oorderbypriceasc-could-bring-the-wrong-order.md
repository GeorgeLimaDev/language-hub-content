## Summary


O=OrderByPriceASC can use wrong policy to order prices



## Simulation



- Enter more than one price on the product. Ex: two different list prices on different sellers
- Put page sorting by price (O=OrderByPriceASC)
- See that the sorting is not in the order of the prices being displayed



## Workaround


None on the Portal. However, the account can switch to Inteligente Search.
