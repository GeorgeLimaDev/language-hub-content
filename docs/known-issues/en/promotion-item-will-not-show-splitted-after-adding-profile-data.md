## Summary


The expected behaviour when applying a More for Less promotion is to have the promotional item separated from the regular items, but the items will be grouped together after adding an email to the checkout.

This behaviour creates an inconsistent experience for the client.


##

## Simulation



- Add enough items to the cart to get a free or discounted one (the promotion and regular items will show splitted);
- Inform an email to proceed with the checkout and fill the customer data (the items will be grouped together)
- Fill the shipping data (the items will split again)


##

## Workaround


N/A
