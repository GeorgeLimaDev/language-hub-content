**Order Replacement** allows customers in your store to change data in orders already placed.

The goal is to help them correct errors without having to manually place a new order or contact your support, which facilitates the operation of your store and reduces costs.

## Enabling order replacement

This feature is available to all stores. To enable it, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings > Orders > Settings**, or type *Orders* in the search bar at the top of the page and select *Store Settings / Orders*.
2. On the **General** tab, in the **Order replacement** field, select the checkbox <a class="far fa-check-square"></a> `Allow customers to make changes to orders`.  
3. Click `Save`.  

Within 15 minutes, after automatic cache refresh, the feature should be available.
