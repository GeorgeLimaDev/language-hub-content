Merchandising rules is the Intelligent Search feature that manipulates results in a search. It allows you to offer more relevant products to the customer and enables the manager to include and delete products pre-selected by the Search Engine.

Merchandising rules are priority criteria. If you configure a rule to promote a specific product given a particular search (for example: promote a specific shirt when the customer searches for "shirt"), this product will be at the top of the results, regardless of the other [Relevance settings](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-intelligent-search--19wrbB7nEQcmwzDPl1l4Cb/1qlObWIib6KqgrfX1FCOXS). 

You can set merchandising rules for:

* **Brands:** You can set which brand products are more relevant than others. When the customer searches for "smartphone," for example, the products of this brand will appear at the beginning of the list, and the other brands' products below them.
* **Product:** Another option is promoting a specific product. For example: set that when searching for "running t-shirt," the product "Running T-shirt" is the first result displayed in the list.
