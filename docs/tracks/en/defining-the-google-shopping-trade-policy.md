After creating your Google Merchant Center account, define the [trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-uma-politica-comercial--563tbcL0TYKEKeOY4IAgAE) that you are going to use. When you [configure a trade policy for a marketplace](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/configurando-a-politica-comercial-para-marketplace/), you determine which products will be submitted to Google Shopping and their price on the platform.

In most cases, we recommend choosing the main trade policy (ID: 1), as Google Shopping results direct the buyer to make the purchase in the advertisersâ€™ stores. Therefore, the integration will submit to Google all the products available in your store, at the same advertised prices.

You will need to request the creation of a new trade policy only if you want to:
- Offer a different product assortment on Google Shopping.
- Sell products at different prices on Google Shopping.

To [request additional trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/contratacao-de-politica-comercial-adicional--61vuFOw4yGh6nwSmkLJL1X), simply fill out the [Trade Policy Release form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9qCGB_KM_xsV5e9uNe06JE8tMZrWcv6EuHUOmqTiM8oRW7w/viewform). If you have any questions, please contact our Growth Operations team through *[Support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support)* by selecting **Commercial** and `Create a trade policy`.

Requesting additional trade policies to integrate with [native connectors](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-native-connector-vtex), [certified connectors (partners)](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/estrategias-de-marketplace-na-vtex--tutorials_402#integrating-with-a-certified-connector-partner), or other VTEX stores is free of charge.

## Submitting product prices

The [price](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/3N9xYhnampRQOrfaTAOxNu) of your product on Google Shopping is determined when you choose the trade policy. It is essential to pay attention to a few things.

If your trade policy includes [list prices](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/3XcXp0r5WrJvogB8KIX4Kx#preco-de-lista) and [computed prices](https://help.vtex.com/pt/tracks/precos-101--6f8pwCns3PJHqMvQSugNfP/7GptzvlPDVM11ojEjywIQx#preco-computado), the latter will be sent to Google Shopping.

When a product is linked to multiple [sellers](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/o-que-e-um-seller--5FkLvhZ3Few4CWWIuYOK2w) in your store, Google Shopping follows the rule to advertise the best available offer.
