In this track, we will explain the step by step to install and configure Customer Credit.

First of all, if this app’s concepts are new to you, we recommend that you read our article on [Customer Credit’s general concepts](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/customer-credit-overview--1uIqTjWxIIIEW0COMg4uE0).

After reading it, you should be able to make purchases at VTEX stores using Customer Credit as a payment method.

This way, we can proceed to the first step, which is installing the app. Check out the walk-through below:

1. Access the VTEX [App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/ "App Store") page;
2. Find the __Customer Credit__ icon;
3. Click on the __“Get”__ button;
4. Fill in the __Account info__ field with your store's __"Account Name"__;
5. Click on the __“Confirm order and begin installation”__ button.

You will then be redirected to your store's Admin. Log in and complete the installation by clicking on the “Install” button, located in the upper right corner of the screen.

With the app installed, the new Customer Credit section will appear in the Admin, within the Transactions module.
