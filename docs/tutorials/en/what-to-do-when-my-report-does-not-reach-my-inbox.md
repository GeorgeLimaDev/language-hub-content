At VTEX, each store can access a report on [data exports](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/exporting-data--tutorials_1125) from [Master Data](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-master-data--4otjBnR27u4WUIciQsmkAw) - our module that gathers information about the customers of the store.

These reports are sent to the email owned by the person who requested the action. However, for reasons not concerning VTEX, such content may take longer than expected to reach the requester's inbox.

However, there is a way to extract this report manually by accessing Master Data.

Let's see how in the following step-by-step:

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Store Settings** > **Storefront** > **Master Data**.
2. Click __Exports__. ![exports-md](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/70bXGj3PhkEfcixEF0ik6I/1ac3c2bd600edaac1440899274a8005b/exportaciones.png)
3. Make sure that the tab currently open is __Applications__.
4. Under __Export Status__, identify the row of the report you want to download.
5. If the __Status__ is __Completed - Download__, click **Download** to download the file.

With this, you will be able access the content even if the original email has not arrived.
