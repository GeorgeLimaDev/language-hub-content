VTEX rigorously evaluates platform resources, testing and identifying vulnerabilities through regular scans and penetration tests. These vulnerability checks are conducted periodically.

If you want to conduct your own penetration test in your store environment, VTEX will evaluate your request and check the feasibility of running the test. Below, you will find the details for submitting a request.

## Penetration tests

To request and schedule a penetration test, follow these steps:

1. Open a ticket with [VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/en/support) to request scheduling a penetration test.
2. If the test is approved by VTEX, our team will ask the necessary details for scheduling the test and signing a confidentiality agreement. If you hire a third-party company to conduct the test, they also have to sign the confidentiality agreement.
3. Update your ticket by attaching the confidentiality agreement and other information requested by VTEX.
4. Save your ticket number. You will need it for future communication.

After receiving your information, the VTEX team will contact you to confirm the penetration test.

## Vulnerability report

After submitting the [request](#requesting-a-security-assessment) and performing your security assessment, if there are any findings, follow these steps:

1. Review and validate all assessment findings. You will need a security resource on your end, especially for an automated scan report.
2. Write a report specifying the following information for each vulnerability found:
    - Which URLs and functionality flows were affected.
    - How the problem was detected.
- What is the impact of this vulnerability on the target app if exploited, including what advantages an intruder could gain.
    - The prioritization and ranking criteria used. Consider using a recognized framework or describe the methodology for ranking the criticality of the vulnerability.
    - Describe the problem, detailing the procedure for replicating the failure. Include screenshots, if possible.
- If you decide to include in the report a section reporting an attack, describe which vulnerabilities were exploited in it. In this case, include image evidence, video is optional.
3. Open a ticket with [VTEX support](https://help.vtex.com/pt/support) and include the following information:
- The ticket number of the [security assessment request](#requesting-a-security-assessment) corresponding to the test.
- Vulnerability report generated as described in item 2.
