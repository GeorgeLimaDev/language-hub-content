To increase transparency and trust among your store's admin users, you can see the records of multiple transactions and their respective times on Audit â€” a module used to search and investigate the store's transaction history with the help of filters.

To access the Audit page, click _Store setup_ > _Audit_. On this page, you can use filters to search, check the last actions performed, and see examples of filters that can be used as a template.

## Performing a search for events on Audit

To start your search in Audit, select the **Audit events** tab. From the **Application** dropdown menu, choose the application you want to search.

By clicking on the **Selected date** button, you can choose a pre-defined date for the search. To select an exact period, click the toggle the **Use custom dates.**

The system only stores records for the last three months.
</div>

You can add more filters to search for events more precisely. Click the **+ Add Filter** button. Select the filtering parameter (_Action_, _Event Details_, or _Author_) and to which value this topic should be compared. 

<div class="alert alert-info">
The search results will match exactly the value entered in the field. To avoid unexpected results, make sure there are no extra spaces in the search terms.
</div>

Note that you can add more than one filter, even with the same value. In this case, search results will return events matching any of the values you have entered. 

For example, the search corresponding to the figure below returned results whose actions are _Payment Notification_ or _Change Status_ and whose author is _[email@email.com](mailto:email@email.com)_.

After selecting the application, the date, and other search filters, click the **Search** button to get the events that were found. 

Every search you perform will be saved in the **Last searches** tab.
