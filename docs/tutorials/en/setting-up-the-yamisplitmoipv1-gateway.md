YamiSplitMoipV1 is a dedicated gateway that extends Moip functionality. With it, it's possible to make payment splits in the marketplaces (which allows the user to make a single payment, even buying products from different sellers) using the sub-acquirer.

## Setting up the gateway affiliation YamiSplitMoipV1
1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
3. Click the __YamiSplitMoipV1__ Connector.
4. Fill in the _Application Key_ and _Application Token_ fields with your __Moip__ account information.
5. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition

After following the steps above, YamiSplitMoipV1 will be configured in your store. Thus, while you are registering a payment condition to be used in a marketplace, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field.
