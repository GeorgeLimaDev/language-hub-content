VTEX uses [trade policies](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/como-funciona-uma-politica-comercial--6Xef8PZiFm40kg2STrMkMV) to establish conditions and sales strategies for a sales channel, such as an ecommerce, a marketplace, a physical store, or a B2B store.

Using trade policies, you can determine catalog, price, promotion, payment, inventory, logistics, and audience segmentation settings for sales channels. It is not necessary to [create a different trade policy](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/criar-uma-politica-comercial--563tbcL0TYKEKeOY4IAgAE) for each sales channel, as the same trade policy can be used in multiple channels.

Requesting additional trade policies to integrate with native connectors, certified connectors (partners), or other VTEX stores is free of charge.
