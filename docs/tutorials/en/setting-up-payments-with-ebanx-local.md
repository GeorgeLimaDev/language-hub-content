At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the Ebanx payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through bank invoice, credit cards and PIX.

To configure Ebanx affiliation, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to __Store Settings > Payments > Settings__, or type __Settings__ in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the `+` button.
3. Click on the __EBANX-Local__ connector.
4. Fill in the __Application Key__ and __Application Token__ fields with data provided by your account Ebanx.
5. If an alert message appears indicating the need to install the app, click on the `Install app` button and follow the installation instructions.
6. Click on `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by Ebanx-Local, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#).

After following the indicated steps, Ebanx-Local connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
