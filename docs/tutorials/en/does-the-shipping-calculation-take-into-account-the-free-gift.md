The system charges shipping bearing in mind the free gift in the shopping cart.

To calculate the shipping, it is necessary to also take into account the volume and weight of the free gift.

## Free Shipping Promotion for free gifts

If this promotion is set up, where the free gift is a product usually sold on the site, shipping will always be free of charge.

## Dealing with selecting the free gift at the front

The front can "uncheck" the selection of the free gift. In this case, the free gift will be displayed below the list of the main items. When selecting the free gift, the customer will see a message from the shopping cart indicating that the shipping cost has increased. So, they can decide whether or not to keep the free gift in the shopping cart.
