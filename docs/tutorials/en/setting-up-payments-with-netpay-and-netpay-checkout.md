At VTEX, it is possible to integrate with the NetPay payment provider. With this connector, your store can make sales through bank invoice, credit cards and redirect.

To configure NetPay affiliation, follow the steps below:

1. Access the __Admin__ VTEX.
2. Click on __Payments__.
3. Then, click on __Settings__.
4. In the __Gateway affiliations__ tab, click on the `+` button.
5. Click on one of the connectors, __NetPay__ or __NetPayCheckout__.
6. Fill in the __Application Key__, __Application Token__ and __Numero del comercio__ fields with data provided by NetPay.
7. If an alert message appears indicating the need to install the app, click on the `Install app` button and follow the installation instructions.
8. Click on `Save`.

To configure the payment methods to be processed by NetPay, access [Configuring Payment Conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions--tutorials_455#).

To set special conditions on payment methods, go to [Configuring payment special conditions](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/special-conditions--tutorials_456#).

After following the indicated steps, NetPay connector may take up to 10 minutes to appear at your store's checkout as a payment option.
