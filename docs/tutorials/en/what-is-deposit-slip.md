Deposit Slip is a popular payment method in __Mexico__. Its operation is very similar to Brazilian bank slips, but with a difference: payment can only be made at authorized places.

## How it works
To pay with Deposit Slip, the user must choose this payment condition at the checkout. Then a barcode document with the payment information will be issued.

To make the purchase effective, the user must go to one of the accredited places and pay the value of the document. This payment can be made in cash or with credit cards.

## How to accept deposit slips in your store
Your VTEX store can accept payments with Deposit Slip, as long as it operates in Mexico and is registered in Citibanamex. This Mexican bank has integration with our platform and can be configured in your store.
