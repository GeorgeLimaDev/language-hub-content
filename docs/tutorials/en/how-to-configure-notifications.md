The notification area of the payments module is responsible for the registration of the email that will receive notifications about actions that need to be taken by the shopkeeper in relation to payments made in their store.

### When does the notification happen?

The email that is registered in this section is notified whenever there is a problem with a payment.

Two examples are a reversal that did not work, and that needs to be done manually, and a catch that did not occur correctly.

### How to register an email to be notified

To register an email, follow the steps below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Access the __Notifications__ tab.
3. Enter the desired e-mail or select to use your own.
4. Click onÂ __Save__.
