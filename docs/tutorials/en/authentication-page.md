On the Authentication page, you can choose which login methods you want to offer to your VTEX store buyers and operators. This page is available in _Account Settings_ > _Authentication_.

![Authentication page](https://images.ctfassets.net/alneenqid6w5/6cbXmuu9GiTfuYnIsuFKQp/06ed0a952614213a04bc68fc8fa5fa4e/Tela_de_Autentica____o_EN.png)

## Login methods

There are currently four ways of logging in to a VTEX store:

* **Access code:** a random numeric code is sent to the user's email, and they use this code to login.
* **Password:** the user creates a password and logs in using the registered email and password.
* **Facebook:** the user logs in using their Facebook account.
* **Google:** the user logs in using their Google account.

| Login method | Online store   | Admin            |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Access code  | Can be enabled | Always available |
| Password     | Can be enabled | Always available |
| Facebook     | Can be enabled | Not available    |
| Google       | Can be enabled | Selectable       |

<div class="alert alert-info">
At least one of the four login methods must be enabled on the Webstore tab.

## Online store

On the **Webstore** tab, you can choose which login methods buyers can use to log in to your store. To enable login with Facebook or Google, click on the respective **Edit** button.
