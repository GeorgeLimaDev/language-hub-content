Getnet, one of the largest [acquirers](/en/tutorial/what-is-an-acquirer) in Brazil, can be configured in your store using the Egetnet connector. We recommend that you use this connector to gain access to the latest integration and to the new Getnet features.

To set up Getnet with the Egetnet connector, follow the steps below:

## Setting up Egetnet gateway affiliation
1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
3. Click the __Egetnet__ connector.
4. In the __Application Key__ field, enter the application key provided by Getnet.
5. In __Application Token__, fill in the field with the token provided by Getnet.
6. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition
After following the steps indicated above, the Egetnet connector will be configured in your store. Thus, when you are registering a payment condition, it will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided the payment method is compatible with Egetnet). To learn how to set up payment conditions, visit [this Help article](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
