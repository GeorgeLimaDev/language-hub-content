Nowadays, we have a limitation on the number of active promotions, fees and coupons.

- [Promotions](/en/tutorial/como-criar-promocoes--tutorials_320): 100
- [Fees](/en/tutorial/creating-surchargestaxes): 100
- [Coupons](/en/tutorial/creating-a-coupon/): 50.000

_Only active promotions, fees or  coupons will be accounted, which means that the filed promotions, fees or coupons will not be considered._

Get in touch with VTEX in case you need to change any of these limits.
