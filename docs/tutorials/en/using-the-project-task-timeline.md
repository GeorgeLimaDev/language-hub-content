The project task timeline is a tool to help planning your project with VTEX. It lists the most important tasks to be done in an order that makes every configuration easier,Â to make sure one task does not depend on another to be completed.

We suggest every project to be started using the [standard project timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mLvOXwmMQKsaMjm40W-7auPD-21eV_rucQio13cKipI/edit#gid=177050342). Remember that start and finish dates for every task must be agreed upon between client and agency.
