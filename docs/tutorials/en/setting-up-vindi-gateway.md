Vindi is a payment gateway with PCI certification, which guarantees the security of the data transacted by it. Currently, it processes payments made with credit cards, bank slips and Paypal.

To set Vindi up, follow the steps below:

## Setting up Vindi gateway affiliation
1. Enter the __Payments__ module.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. On the __Gateway Affiliations__ tab, click the __+__ button.
4. Click the __Vindi__ connector.
5. Fill in the registration fields with the data provided by Vindi (_Application Key_ and _Application Token_ fields).
6. Click __Save__.

## Setting up the payment condition

After following the steps above, Vindi will be configured in your store. Thus, while you're registering a payment condition, this gateway will be available in the __Process with affiliation__ field (provided that the payment methods are compatible with Vindi).
