In order to terminate your agreement and to stop using VTEX platform, you must open a [ticket](https://support.vtex.com/hc/en-us/requests) communicating your decision to the financial team.

## Make sure that your ticket contains the following information:

- Tax ID Card
- Social contract
- Full data of the current legal representative, who will sign the distract document (Name / ID / CPF (Brazil) / Email)

Once this is done, the internal process will be started and then a distraction for electronic signature will be sent via __Clicksign__.

If the client's desire for termination is confirmed, __no fine will be charged.__ The last charge made will correspond to the month of the request for termination. Your administrative panel will be __removed within the first 5 days of the month following the request__.
