We recommend that you limit purchases to a payment method only [through trade policy](/en/tutorial/limit-purchases-to-a-payment-method-through-trade-policy).

Another perhaps simpler way is to customize the Checkout so that the CSS will omit the means of payment for the UTM in question. 

<div class="alert alert-danger">But remember that VTEX does not recommend customizing the Checkout, since SmartCheckout exists to maximize efficiency in the purchase closing flow.</div>
