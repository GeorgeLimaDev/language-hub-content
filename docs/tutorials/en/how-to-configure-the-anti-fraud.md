The anti-fraud is an external system that identifies frauds, increasing the security of all purchases. On VTEX, you can choose between some anti-fraud options. And setting them up is very simple.

## How to configure

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Store Settings** > **Payment** > **Settings**, or type **Settings** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Access the **Gateway Affiliations** tab.
3. Click on **+**.
4. Click on the anti-fraud you want to configure.
5. Fill out the form fields with the data provided by the anti-fraud (EntityCode).
6. Click on **Save**.

After the configuration at Gateway Affiliations, you need to access the Payment Conditions, and associate the anti-fraud to each one of them.

1. Access the **Payment Conditions** tab.
2. Click on the desired condition or [create the payment condition](/en/tutorial/how-to-configure-payment-conditions).
3. Select the **Use anti-fraud** option.
4. Select which anti-fraud you want to use.
7. Click on **Save**.
