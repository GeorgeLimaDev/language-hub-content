Yes. By default, the minimum quantity of items in the cart is 1 item. However, you can change this value and specify the number that the store understands to be right for your business.

If you change the number from 1 *(default)* to 2, this will prevent the customer from closing the purchase without having at least 2 items in the cart.

__To change this number, follow the steps below: __

1. In the VTEX Admin, go to **Apps** > **Affiliates** > **Orders Management**, or type **Orders Management** in the search bar at the top of the page.
2. Click on __Settings__.
3. Set the value of the __Minimum number of items in cart__.
4. Click the __Update__ button.
