SLA - "Service Level Agreement" - is the specification, in measurable and clear terms, of all the services that you, as a contractor, can expect from VTEX.

__The SLA expresses the service level of the platform infrastructure__ and technically clarifies its uptime and operational inactivity, as well as all events that are considered incidents.

We currently have four levels of service which may vary according to your [store's contract edition](http://www.vtex.com/pricing).
