To export your customer base that have chosen to receive newsletter, follow the step-by-step below:

1. In the VTEX Admin, access **Store Settings** > **Storefront** > **Master Data.**
2. Click on the **Clientes** tab.
3. Click **Export XLS.**
4. Select the `Receive Newsletter?` filter, as well as others you like (`Name` and `email`, for example).
5. Click on **Export.**
6. A window will appear informing you that the export has been successfully programmed. Click **OK** to close it.
7. In the spreadsheet that has been sent to your email there will be a column titled `isNewsletterOptIn`, which assigns the value **true** to customers who receive newsletter and **false** to those who do not.

_This option is only valid for stores with their Newsletter registered in the CRM. If your store is not yet configured in this way, and still uses the page control, read the articleÂ [Configuring the inclusion of a newsletter in Master Data](/en/tutorial/how-do-i-configure-the-inclusion-of-newsletter-in-master-data--frequentlyAskedQuestions_1816) to find out how to do it._
