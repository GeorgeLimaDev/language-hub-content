Creating a cluster of customers is the same as segmenting them. These two approaches give the storeowner a better idea of the customer’s profile, and enable you to be more proactive in dealing with this user.

These details, once obtained, are very useful for the company’s marketing and advertising. Each store can define its own clusters and the rules for a customer to be included in each of them.

The purpose of this article is to show how to configure your CRM to create a cluster.

1. The first step is to create a field in the MasterData with the name of the cluster you want. E.g.: Dealers. In this way customers who are dealers will be highlighted, and can be offered an exclusive promotion, for example. [Access our manual on how to create a field](/en/faq/how-can-i-create-field-in-master-data/).
2. Then create this field in the form, so that the data can be seen. [For this, see our manual](/en/faq/how-can-i-create-field-in-master-data/).

So technically, a cluster in CRM is nothing more than a field.

To populate this field you can use an [import worksheet](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/importing-data-into-master-data--tutorials_1135 "How to import data into Master Data") or an API, or you can do it manually using the Customer form in CRM. Everything depends on the store’s strategy for clusterizing its customers.
