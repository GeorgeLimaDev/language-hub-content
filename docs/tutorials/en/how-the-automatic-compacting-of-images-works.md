VTEX stores have automatic compacting of images for __WebP__. This tool cuts the weight of the site by up to 25%.

![webplogo](//images.contentful.com/alneenqid6w5/1HsHoCbkyM86KKA4sCWucO/0e6f078eb62b773cc927da79b8ea6f1e/webplogo.png)

The format, developed by Google, is more efficient than JPG or PNG, without necessarily reducing the quality of the images. It easily affords a gain of 1 or 2 seconds in page loading time (varying according to the layout).

Both the quicker speed and the use of the format result in better organic ranking by Google.

The files are stored in their original format, but converted in real time when requested from the server by compatible browsers. Google Chrome is the main browser for this: currently it is used in 70% of accesses to VTEX, and it now supports WebP.

Browsers not yet compatible with the format and services such as integrations and marketplaces, receive an unconverted image. Currently GIF is not converted in this way.

More information on WebP can be found on the Google site: https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/
